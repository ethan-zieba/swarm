_We could have used Prometheus_
Both Prometheus and InfluxDB store data and sort them by the exact time they were recorded
InfluxDB may be easier to handle at first, InfluxQL (SQL-like) is really functional, has a smaller ecosystem
Both are useful for numerical data
InfluxDB seems more lightweight
