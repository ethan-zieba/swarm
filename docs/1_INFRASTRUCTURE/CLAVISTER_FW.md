### ALGs

"_cOS Core provides a range of Application Level Gateways (ALGs) which provide security features that examine traffic at higher OSI layers such as checking that file download content agrees with the given filetype. Another example is the SIP ALG which examines the SIP message exchanges that take place during the setup of peer to peer data exchanges._"
