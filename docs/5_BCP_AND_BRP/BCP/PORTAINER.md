# Summary

Portainer is a powerful yet user-friendly management tool for Docker environments, providing a straightforward web interface to control and monitor containers. 
It simplifies complex Docker operations, allowing to deploy, manage, and troubleshoot containers without needing to dive deep into command-line. 
Ideal for both new and experienced users. Efficient infrastructure and easy to oversee.

# Key concepts

- Volumes: Persistent storage areas where container data is stored even if the container is removed or recreated.
- Environments: Different Docker setups or clusters that can be connected to and managed using Portainer.
- Hosts: Physical or virtual machines on which the Docker engine and containers are run.
- Resources: CPU, memory, and storage limits and usage that are allocated to or available for containers and hosts.
- Network: A virtual or physical layer configured within Portainer that enables communication and data exchange between containers, services, and external endpoints.
