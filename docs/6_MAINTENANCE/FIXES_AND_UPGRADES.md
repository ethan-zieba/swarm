# Role of Ansible

Ansible is important in maintenance by automating **fixes**, allowing patches and configuration changes to be applied quickly and consistently across all hosts without manual intervention. 
During **upgrades**, Ansible ensures that software and system updates are deployed in a manageable, repeatable way, minimizing downtime and ensuring a smooth workflow.
Ansible streamlines both routine fixes and complex upgrades, making maintenance more efficient and reliable.
